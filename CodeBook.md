##Raw Data
The dataset that is generated by this code is created from the **Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set** which is located at the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  Further description of the source can be found here:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The raw data set for this code is a copy of the one available from UCI and  was stored here for reference:

For reference, here is the description of the raw data experiment which is included with the raw data:

> The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

> The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

A further description of the summary variables included with the raw data set, also directly quoted from the original source documentation is listed below for reference:

> The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

> Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

> Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

> These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Each of the variables listed above were provided in the raw dataset sumarized using a variety of functions including mean and standard deviation values.  The result data set described by this codebook comes from the mean and standard deviation values provided in the raw data set.

##Selection of Summary Quantities
Additional summary quantities beyond standard mean and standard deviation were provided including the **Mean Frequency**.  Mean Frequency was not included in the output as it is based on a weighted average of frequencies as opposed to a stright average (and the assignment only asked for the mean and standard deviation of each variable).

##Units
All values of the raw summary variables were normalized to remove units from their values.  They all range from a value of -1 to 1 and so each of the resultant means described below is dimensionless.

##Variables Reported in this Data Set
The dataset created by the attached code consists the mean of each of the mean and standard deviation of variables in the raw data set, for each user and activity.
